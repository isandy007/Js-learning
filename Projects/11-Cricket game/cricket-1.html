    <!-- In this code, we have created a simple cricket game where the user can choose between Bat, Ball, and Stump. The computer's choice is determined randomly using Math.random(). After both the user and the computer have made their choices, we compare them to determine the winner and print the result in the console. The game is designed to be simple and easy to understand, making it a fun way to learn about basic programming concepts like random number generation and conditional statements. -->
