        // Basic way to declare a function. function keyword followed by the name of the function and parentheses. Inside the parentheses, we can define parameters that the function can take. The body of the function is enclosed in curly braces.

        // Anonymous function: A function without a name. It can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to another function. Anonymous functions are often used in situations where a function is needed temporarily, such as in event handlers or callbacks.

        // Higher-order function: A function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions are a powerful tool in functional programming and allow for more flexible and reusable code.
/*         let sum = function(a,b){
            return a+b;
        }

        console.log(sumArrowShort(7,6)); */

        // When we have only one parameter, we can omit the parentheses around the parameter.
/*         let square = num => num*num;

        // setTimeout: A built-in function in JavaScript that allows us to execute a function after a specified delay. It takes two arguments: the function to be executed and the delay in milliseconds.

The alarm function will be executed every 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds). The new Date().toLocaleTimeString() will log the current time when the alarm function is executed.

The alarm function will be executed every 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds). We can also use setTimeout to clear the interval after a certain amount of time (in this case, 10000 milliseconds or 10 seconds).

        // Event listeners: A way to execute a function in response to an event, such as a user clicking a button or submitting a form. We can use the addEventListener method to attach an event listener to an element and specify the function to be executed when the event occurs.
